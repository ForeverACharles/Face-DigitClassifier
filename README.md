# Classifier for Faces and Digits

Created by Charles Li and Nicholas Schenk

This project implements 3 algorithms for identifying faces and digits using:
- Perceptron
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbor

### Changelog

11/26: created read.py. reads data from both face and number files into an array

11/26: created runner.py, perceptron.py. Refactored read.py to be work with main runner. Added debugging print statements

12/6: implemented naive bayes. Still needs feature extraction to perform better than 50% accuracy
